									<h2>Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion</h2>

								</header>
								<p></span>I feel that those currently in STEM fields should actively work to be inclusive and welcoming to everyone. I challenge myself to create and collaborate in programs that focus on generating accessible pathways to STEM careers. I am particularly passionate about helping support single mothers and those from underrepresented groups enter and find success in grad school. </p>

                                                                                          Graduate Student Mentor to Prospective Students | 2020<br />
                                                                                         UC Davis <br />

				I was a mentor in the <b>Evolution & Ecology Graduate School Preview</b>, a <b>five-week virtual program</b> for senior undergraduate and Masters students from all over the country that covered topics related to entering graduate programs in EEB. The goal of the program was to bring transparency to the process of applying to grad school from finding the right lab, writing personal statements, understanding funding, and chosing the right program. This program was created by the UC Davis Population Biology Diversity Committee, who strives to create diversity in EEB in a way that is reflective of the great diversity in California.<b>All our materials, including slides and session recordings, are freely available on <a href="http://www.eegradpreview.weebly.com/">our the E&E Grad Preview website (linked here).</a> </b> <br />
				The very first Preview Day was held August-September 2020, with 40 students! Praise for the program from students:
				<blockquote> "[E&E Graduate Preview] exceeded my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of personal experience presented concerning grad school work/social life. I liked how heavily that was mentioned when considering a program and a PI." </blockquote>
				<blockquote> "[E&E Graduate Preview] shed some light on important things to know before applying to the program. Very welcoming and safe environment for inquiry." </blockquote>
				<blockquote>  "...the overall style of the presentations and the obvious support and effort that each of the facilitators put into these seminars made me feel like I can do well as a graduate student as well." </blockquote>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Family Life.jpg" alt="" /></span><b>Coastal and Marine Science Institute</b><br /> <b>Graduate Student Affairs Committee </b> 	<br />
Professional Development Subcommittee| 2020-Present<br />
UC Davis <br />

I am a member of the Professional Development Subcommittee for the CMSI Graduate Student Affairs Committee. My role to ensure that graduate students in all of the graduate programs affiliated with CMSI have resources to continue to grow in their career goals. Additionally, the professional development subcommittee strives to provide resources to prospective students to help with applying for graduate degrees related to coastal and marine sciences. Through my committee member position, I have organized a workshop which included 3 panels, one where panelists discussed pregnancy and motherhood in academia, one discussing managing academic careers and the unexpected challenges of parenthood (including medical needs of children), and the last panel focused on how parenting while maintaining an academic career changes as children grow older. Each panelist provided their perspective on how their role as a parent has been accommodated by their place of work and as a group panelists and attendees workshopped ways to improve the accessibility of academia to parents with an emphasis on mothers. From the ideas generated during this workshop, such as increasing the normality of bringing young children to work, I hope to develop assistance programs to increase graduate school attendance for parents in underrepresented minority groups. <br />
