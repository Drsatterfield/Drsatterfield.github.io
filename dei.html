									<h2>Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion</h2>
									
								</header>
								<p></span>I am committed to expanding access within STEM fields to historically minoritized students, both through recruitment initiatives and by creating a more inclusive environment within the STEM community.</p>

                                                                                         Founding Logistics Coordinator | 2020<br />

						Graduate programs and most departments in Evolution, Ecology, & Behavior (EEB) fields are predominantly white. We at the Population Biology Graduate Group Diversity Committee think we can do better, especially in a state with as diverse a population as California. Though there are many graduate recruitment initiatives between UCs and the nearby CSU system, many are geared towards students interested in biomedical graduate programs. <b>Evolution & Ecology Graduate School Preview Day</b> is a daylong program that will bring senior undergraduate and Masters students from local CSU campuses to UC Davis for a day to learn about graduate opportunities in EEB fields through informational sessions, panels, and networking events with faculty and graduate students. <br />
Our very first Preview Day will be held at UC Davis on May 1, 2020. We are excited to invite ~20 students to Davis for our upcoming event.			</p>

<span class="image left"><img src="images/Fish_Shapes_Class_2018.jpg" alt="" /></span>I co-instructed three quarters in a yearlong course series with <a href="https://stfriedman.github.io/index.html">Sarah Friedman</a> and <a href="https://fishmorph.com/">Chris Martinez</a>. We brought 17 undergraduates through the entirety of the research process in a CURE (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience). Using the then-developing <a href="/pdfs/Price et al 2019 accepted.pdf">Fish Shapes dataset</a> as a basis, our students designed and executed their own projects. In the fall, we discussed how to read the scientific literature and form testable hypotheses, ultimately having the class choose and expand 2 student-submitted hypotheses. In the winter, we introduced the students to R and using the basics of phylogenetic comparative statistical methods, using their own data to learn these methods. In the spring, our students presented their projects to their family and friends at the UC Davis Undergraduate Research Symposium. I designed curriculum, organized projects, and wrote & presented lectures. <br />
						
We wrote a pedagogy paper about our experience with the Fish Shapes CURE: look for it soon from <i>Integrative Organismal Biology</i>! <br /></p>

As a teaching assistant for an introductory-level course in the biological sciences curriculum, I instructed and graded lab sections and proctored exams. Lab topics range from population and quantitative genetics with fruit flies to assessing diversity in different plant communities and predation experiments with Gambusia and mosquito larvae. <b>Overall TA evaluation (n = 98): 4.9/5.0.</b>
