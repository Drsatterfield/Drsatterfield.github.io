									<p><span><a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/fishhh.PNG" alt="" /></a></span>Iâ€™m a PhD student at in the population biology graduate group at UC Davis. I am in the <a href="https://fishlab.ucdavis.edu/"> Wainwright Lab </a>. I am a behavioral ecologist, who is rapidly being emersed into the field of functional morphology. I specialize in the use of video and photography to collect data on fish behaviors with minimal disturbance. Currently, I'm working on measuring the diversity of swimming behaviors in reef fish. I wil be evaluating the relationships between functional morphology and swimming modes in fish. I recently completed my masters research at <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/biological-sciences"> California State University, Long Beach </a>, where I studied behavioral local adaptation in a marine fish. During my undergraduate program at <a href="https://www.csun.edu/science-mathematics/biology"> California State University, Northridge </a>, I studied courtship success and foraging trade-offs in a marine fish. Information about these projects and updates on my current work can be found in the "Research" tab of this page. <b>You can contact me at Drsatterfield 'at' ucdavis 'dot' edu.</b></p>

										<h2>Using 3D videography to <br />

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/camerarig.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Currently I am collecting data on fish swimming behaviors from stereo video collected off the coast of Mayotte, a small island in the Mozambique Channel. My aim is to examine how diverse reef fish are in their swimming modes and identify functional traits which are related to diversity in swimming behaviors.</p>

									<p>New Paper Alert: Can populations become locally adapted in behavior even with moderate spatial variation in selection pressure? We measured reactivity to risk in populations of black surfperch, Embiotoca jacksoni (a non-model marine fish) which experience different levels of spearfishing pressure. We found clear evidence of local adaptation such that high risk populations are much more reactive than low risk populations.</p>

										<h2>Effects of size and sex on<br />

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Paper1fig.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>How do body size and sex influence how fish allocate time to foraging versus reproductive activities? We measured the effects of size and sex on courting success and foraging behaviour of black surfperch Embiotoca jacksoni off Santa Catalina Island. Pairs that were closely matched in size had long courting sessions, whereas those that differed considerably in size courted only briefly. Small fish foraged more than larger fish, both during and outside the mating season. Males and females foraged at similar rates outside of the mating season, but during the mating season males reduced their foraging rates to less than half that seen outside of the mating season, whereas females continued to forage at the same rate. </p>

										<h2> Geographic variation in demography <br />
										 of black perch (Embiotoca jacksoni)</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/bsp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Spatial variation in demography is common among populations of marine fish. However, the factors which have the greatest effect on demography and demographic rates are often unclear. We tested whether spatial variation in demography was associated with several explanatory variables including population density, predator density, food availability, and fishing activity. Spatial variation in growth was most sensitive to variation in food availability and mean age was lowest at locations with high levels of spearfishing activity. </p>
